Saga Test Plan\n\n\n\nPowerful test helpers for Redux Saga.\nRedux Saga Test Plan makes testing sagas a breeze. Whether you need to test\nexact effects and their ordering or just test your saga put's a specific\naction at some point, Redux Saga Test Plan has you covered.\nRedux Saga Test Plan aims to embrace both unit testing and integration testing\napproaches to make testing your sagas easy.\nIntegration Testing\nRequires global Promise to be available\nOne downside to unit testing sagas is that it couples your test to your\nimplementation. Simple reordering of yielded effects in your saga could break\nyour tests even if the functionality stays the same. If you're not concerned\nwith the order or exact effects your saga yields, then you can take a\nintegrative approach, testing the behavior of your saga when run by Redux Saga.\nThen, you can simply test that a particular effect was yielded during the saga\nrun. For this, use the expectSaga test function.\nSimple Example\nimport { expectSaga } from 'redux-saga-test-plan';\n\nfunction identity(value) {\n  return value;\n}\n\nfunction* mainSaga(x, y) {\n  const action = yield take('HELLO');\n\n  yield put({ type: 'ADD', payload: x + y });\n  yield call(identity, action);\n}\n\nit('just works!', () => {\n  return expectSaga(mainSaga, 40, 2)\n    // assert that the saga will eventually yield `put`\n    // with the expected action\n    .put({ type: 'ADD', payload: 42 })\n\n    // dispatch any actions your saga will `take`\n    .dispatch({ type: 'HELLO' })\n\n    // run it\n    .run();\n});\n\nExample with Reducer\nimport { expectSaga } from 'redux-saga-test-plan';\n\nconst HAVE_BIRTHDAY = 'HAVE_BIRTHDAY';\nconst AGE_BEFORE = 'AGE_BEFORE';\nconst AGE_AFTER = 'AGE_AFTER';\n\nconst initialDog = {\n  name: 'Tucker',\n  age: 11,\n};\n\nfunction dogReducer(state = initialDog, action) {\n  if (action.type === HAVE_BIRTHDAY) {\n    return {\n      ...state,\n      age: state.age + 1,\n    };\n  }\n\n  return state;\n}\n\nfunction getAge(state) {\n  return state.age;\n}\n\nfunction* saga() {\n  const ageBefore = yield select(getAge);\n\n  yield put({ type: AGE_BEFORE, payload: ageBefore });\n\n  yield take(HAVE_BIRTHDAY);\n\n  const ageAfter = yield select(getAge);\n\n  yield put({ type: AGE_AFTER, payload: ageAfter });\n}\n\nit('handles reducers', () => {\n  return expectSaga(saga)\n    .withReducer(dogReducer)\n\n    .put({ type: AGE_BEFORE, payload: 11 })\n    .put({ type: AGE_AFTER, payload: 12 })\n\n    .dispatch({ type: HAVE_BIRTHDAY })\n\n    .run();\n});\n\nYes, it's that simple to test with expectSaga.\nUnit Testing\nIf you want to ensure that your saga yields specific types of effects in a\nparticular order, then you'll want to use the testSaga function. Here's a\nsimple example:\nimport { testSaga } from 'redux-saga-test-plan';\n\nfunction identity(value) {\n  return value;\n}\n\nfunction* mainSaga(x, y) {\n  const action = yield take('HELLO');\n\n  yield put({ type: 'ADD', payload: x + y });\n  yield call(identity, action);\n}\n\nconst action = { type: 'TEST' };\n\nit('works with unit tests', () => {\n  testSaga(mainSaga, 40, 2);\n    // advance saga with `next()`\n    .next()\n\n    // assert that the saga yields `take` with `'HELLO'` as type\n    .take('HELLO')\n\n    // pass back in a value to a saga after it yields\n    .next(action)\n\n    // assert that the saga yields `put` with the expected action\n    .put({ type: 'ADD', payload: 42 })\n\n    .next()\n\n    // assert that the saga yields a `call` to `identity` with\n    // the `action` argument\n    .call(identity, action)\n\n    .next()\n\n    // assert that the saga is finished\n    .isDone();\n});\n\nTable of Contents\n\nIntroduction\nGetting Started\nIntegration Testing\nEffect Creator Assertions\nDispatching\nTimeout\nState\nMocking\nStatic Providers\nDynamic Providers\n\n\nPartial Assertions\nNegated Assertions\nForked Sagas\n\n\nUnit Testing\nError Messages\nEffect Creators\nSaga Helpers\nGeneral Assertions\nTime Travel\n\n\n\n"},"getting-started.html":{"url":"getting-started.html","title":"Getting Started","keywords":"","body":"Getting Started\nInstall\nThe recommended way to install redux-saga-test-plan is with a package manager\nlike yarn or npm.\nyarn\nyarn add redux-saga-test-plan --dev\nnpm\nnpm install --save-dev redux-saga-test-plan\n"},"integration-testing/":{"url":"integration-testing/","title":"Integration Testing","keywords":"","body":"Integration Testing\nRequires global Promise to be available\nFor integration testing, Redux Saga Test Plan exports an expectSaga function\nthat returns an API for asserting that a saga yields certain effects.

If you don't want\nto handle the effect yourself, you can pass it on to Redux Saga by invoking the\nnext callback parameter.\nHere is an example with Jest to show you how to supply a fake value for an API\ncall:\nimport { call, put, take } from 'redux-saga/effects';\nimport { expectSaga } from 'redux-saga-test-plan';\nimport api from 'my-api';\n\nfunction* saga() {\n  const action = yield take('REQUEST_USER');\n  const id = action.payload;\n\n  const user = yield call(api.fetchUser, id);\n\n  yield put({ type: 'RECEIVE_USER', payload: user });\n}\n\nit('provides a value for the API call', () => {\n  return expectSaga(saga)\n    .provide({\n      call(effect, next) {\n        // Check for the API call to return fake value\n        if (effect.fn === api.fetchUser) {\n          const id = effect.args[0];\n          return { id, name: 'John Doe' };\n        }\n\n        // Allow Redux Saga to handle other `call` effects\n        return next();\n      },\n    })\n    .put({\n      type: 'RECEIVE_USER',\n      payload: { id: 1, name: 'John Doe' },\n    })\n    .dispatch({ type: 'REQUEST_USER', payload: 1 })\n    .run();\n});\n\nEffect Creators\nEven though you'll probably never need them all, you can supply a provider for\nalmost every effect creator*:\n\nactionChannel\ncall\ncancel\ncancelled\ncps\nflush\nfork\njoin\nparallel (handle yielded arrays)\nput\nrace\nselect\nspawn\ntake\n\n*Because there is no way to distinguish the apply and call effects, you\nmust handle apply effects with the call provider function.\n*To handle take.maybe and put.resolve, use the take and put providers,\nrespectively. You can inspect take effects for the maybe property and put\neffects for the resolve property.\nOther Examples\nSelect\nimport { put, select } from 'redux-saga/effects';\nimport { expectSaga } from 'redux-saga-test-plan';\nimport { selectors } from 'my-selectors';\n\nfunction* saga() {\n  const name = yield select(selectors.getName);\n  const age = yield select(selectors.getAge);\n\n  yield put({ type: 'USER', payload: { name, age } });\n}\n\nit('provides a value for the selector', () => {\n  return expectSaga(saga)\n    .provide({\n      select({ selector }, next) {\n        if (selector === selectors.getName) {\n          return 'Tucker';\n        }\n\n        if (selector === selectors.getAge) {\n          return 11;\n        }\n\n        return next();\n      },\n    })\n    .put({\n      type: 'USER',\n      payload: { name: 'Tucker', age: 11 },\n    })\n    .run();\n});\n\nParallel Effects\nProviders work on effects yielded inside an array:\nimport { put, select } from 'redux-saga/effects';\nimport { expectSaga } from 'redux-saga-test-plan';\nimport { selectors } from 'my-selectors';\n\nfunction* saga() {\n  const [name, age] = yield [\n    select(selectors.getName),\n    select(selectors.getAge),\n  ];\n\n  yield put({ type: 'USER', payload: { name, age } });\n}\n\nit('provides values for effects inside arrays', () => {\n  return expectSaga(saga)\n    .provide({\n      select({ selector }, next) {\n        if (selector === selectors.getName) {\n          return 'Tucker';\n        }\n\n        if (selector === selectors.getAge) {\n          return 11;\n        }\n\n        return next();\n      },\n    })\n    .put({\n      type: 'USER',\n      payload: { name: 'Tucker', age: 11 },\n    })\n    .run();\n});\n\nOr you can provide a value for the entire array of effects:\nimport { put, select } from 'redux-saga/effects';\nimport { expectSaga } from 'redux-saga-test-plan';\nimport { selectors } from 'my-selectors';\n\nfunction* saga() {\n  const [name, age] = yield [\n    select(selectors.getName),\n    select(selectors.getAge),\n  ];\n\n  yield put({ type: 'USER', payload: { name, age } });\n}\n\nit('provides a value for the entire array', () => {\n  return expectSaga(saga)\n    .provide({\n      parallel: () => ['Tucker', 11],\n    })\n    .put({\n      type: 'USER',\n      payload: { name: 'Tucker', age: 11 },\n    })\n    .run();\n});\n\nRace\nimport { call, put, race, take } from 'redux-saga/effects';\nimport { expectSaga } from 'redux-saga-test-plan';\nimport api from 'my-api';\n\nconst delay = time => (\n  new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, time))\n);\n\nfunction* saga() {\n  const action = yield take('REQUEST_USER');\n  const id = action.payload;\n\n  const { user } = yield race({\n    user: call(api.fetchUser, id),\n    timeout: call(delay, 500),\n  });\n\n  if (user) {\n    yield put({ type: 'RECEIVE_USER', payload: user });\n  } else {\n    yield put({ type: 'TIMEOUT' });\n  }\n}\n\ntest('fetching the user succeeds', () => {\n  const fakeUser = { id: 1, name: 'John Doe' };\n\n  return expectSaga(saga)\n    .provide({\n      race: () => ({ user: fakeUser }),\n    })\n    .put({ type: 'RECEIVE_USER', payload: fakeUser })\n    .dispatch({ type: 'REQUEST_USER' })\n    .run();\n});\n\ntest('timeout wins', () => {\n  return expectSaga(saga)\n    .provide({\n      race: () => ({ timeout: undefined }),\n    })\n    .put({ type: 'TIMEOUT' })\n    .dispatch({ type: 'REQUEST_USER' })\n    .run();\n});\n\nErrors\nYou can simulate errors by throwing from a provider:\nfunction* saga() {\n  const action = yield take('REQUEST_USER');\n  const id = action.payload;\n\n  try {\n    const user = yield call(api.fetchUser, id);\n\n    yield put({ type: 'RECEIVE_USER', payload: user });\n  } catch (e) {\n    yield put({ type: 'FAIL_USER', error: e });\n  }\n}\n\nit('can throw errors in the saga', () => {\n  const error = new Error('Whoops...');\n\n  return expectSaga(saga)\n    .provide({\n      call(effect, next) {\n        if (effect.fn === api.fetchUser) {\n          throw error;\n        }\n\n        return next();\n      },\n    })\n    .put({ error, type: 'FAIL_USER' })\n    .dispatch({ type: 'REQUEST_USER', payload: 1 })\n    .run();\n});\n\nProviding in Forked/Spawned Sagas\nProviders work for effects in forked/spawned sagas too.\nimport { call, fork, put } from 'redux-saga/effects';\nimport { expectSaga } from 'redux-saga-test-plan';\nimport api from 'my-api';\n\nfunction* fetchUserSaga() {\n  const user = yield call(api.fetchUser);\n  yield put({ type: 'RECEIVE_USER', payload: user });\n}\n\nfunction* forkingSaga() {\n  yield fork(fetchUserSaga);\n}\n\nfunction* spawningSaga() {\n  yield spawn(fetchUserSaga);\n}\n\nit('provides values in forked sagas', () => {\n  return expectSaga(forkingSaga)\n    .provide({\n      call({ fn }, next) {\n        if (fn === api.fetchUser) {\n          return fakeUser;\n        }\n\n        return next();\n      },\n    })\n    .put({ type: 'RECEIVE_USER', payload: fakeUser })\n    .run();\n});\n\nit('provides values in spawned sagas', () => {\n  return expectSaga(spawningSaga)\n    .provide({\n      call({ fn }, next) {\n        if (fn === api.fetchUser) {\n          return fakeUser;\n        }\n\n        return next();\n      },\n    })\n    .put({ type: 'RECEIVE_USER', payload: fakeUser })\n    .run();\n});\n\nMultiple Providers\nYou can supply multiple object providers via a couple methods. The easiest way\nis to pass in an array of object providers to the provide method. Provider\nfunctions will be composed according to the effect type, meaning the provider\nfunctions in the first object will be called before subsequent provider\nfunctions in the array.\nBecause provider functions are composed, they are similar to middleware. The\nnext function argument inside provider functions allows you to delegate to the\nnext provider in the middleware stack. If no more providers are available, then\nnext will delegate to Redux Saga to handle the effect as normal.\nimport { call, put, select } from 'redux-saga/effects';\nimport api from 'my-api';\nimport * as selectors from 'my-selectors';\n\nfunction* saga() {\n  const user = yield call(api.findUser, 1);\n  const dog = yield call(api.findDog);\n  const greeting = yield call(api.findGreeting);\n  const otherData = yield select(selectors.getOtherData);\n\n  yield put({\n    type: 'DONE',\n    payload: { user, dog, greeting, otherData },\n  });\n}\n\nconst fakeUser = { name: 'John Doe' };\nconst fakeDog = { name: 'Tucker' };\nconst fakeOtherData = { foo: 'bar' };\n\nconst provideUser = ({ fn, args: [id] }, next) => (\n  fn === api.findUser ? fakeUser : next()\n);\n\nconst provideDog = ({ fn }, next) => (\n  fn === api.findDog ? fakeDog : next()\n);\n\nconst provideOtherData = ({ selector }, next) => (\n  selector === selectors.getOtherData ? fakeOtherData : next()\n);\n\nit('takes multiple providers and composes them', () => {\n  return expectSaga(saga)\n    .provide([\n      { call: provideUser, select: provideOtherData },\n      { call: provideDog },\n    ])\n    .put({\n      type: 'DONE',\n      payload: {\n        user: fakeUser,\n        dog: fakeDog,\n        greeting: 'hello',\n        otherData: fakeOtherData,\n      },\n    })\n    .run();\n});\n\nAn alternative to supplying multiple provider objects is to only pass one object\ninto provide and use the composeProviders function to compose multiple\nprovider functions for a specific effect. You can import the composeProviders\nfunction from the redux-saga-test-plan/providers module. The provider\nfunctions are composed from left to right.\nimport { composeProviders } from 'redux-saga-test-plan/providers';\n\nit('takes multiple providers and composes them', () => {\n  return expectSaga(saga)\n    .provide({\n      call: composeProviders(\n        provideUser,\n        provideDog\n      ),\n\n      select: provideOtherData,\n    })\n    .put({\n      type: 'DONE',\n      payload: {\n        user: fakeUser,\n        dog: fakeDog,\n        greeting: 'hello',\n        otherData: fakeOtherData,\n      },\n    })\n    .run();\n});\n\nMore Examples\nFor some more contrived examples of providers, look in the\nrepo tests.\n"},"integration-testing/partial-matching.html":{"url":"integration-testing/partial-matching.html","title":"Partial Assertions","keywords":"","body":"Partial Matching Assertions\nSometimes you're not interested in the exact arguments passed to a call effect\ncreator or the payload inside an action from a put effect. Instead you're only\nconcerned with if a particular function was invoked via call or if a\nparticular action type was dispatched via put. You can handle these situations\nwith partial matcher assertions.\nThe following assertions have a like method along with convenient helper\nmethods for partially matching assertions:\n\nactionChannel\napply\ncall\ncps\nfork\nput\nput.resolve\nselect\nspawn\n\nNOTE: the like method requires knowledge of the properties on effects such\nas the fn property of call and the action property of put. Essentially,\nlike allows you to match effects with certain properties without worrying\nabout the other properties. Therefore, you can match a call by fn without\nworrying about the args property.\nExample\nHere is a simple example using like:\nfunction* userSaga(id) {\n  try {\n    const user = yield call(api.fetchUser, id);\n    yield put({ type: 'RECEIVE_USER', payload: user });\n  } catch (e) {\n    yield put({ type: 'FAIL_USER', error: e });\n  }\n}\n\nit('fetches user', () => {\n  return expectSaga(userSaga)\n    .call.like({ fn: api.fetchUser })\n    .run();\n});\n\nit('fails', () => {\n  return expectSaga(userSaga)\n    .provide({\n      call() {\n        throw new Error('Not Found');\n      },\n    })\n    .put.like({ action: { type: 'FAIL_USER' } })\n    .run();\n});\n\nNotice that we can assert that the api.fetchUser function was called without\nspecifying the arguments. We can also assert in a failure scenario that an\naction of type FAIL_USER was dispatched without worrying about the error\nproperty of the action.\nHelper Methods Example\nWe can simplify the previous example with the convenient matcher helper methods\ncall.fn and put.actionType:\nfunction* userSaga(id) {\n  try {\n    const user = yield call(api.fetchUser, id);\n    yield put({ type: 'RECEIVE_USER', payload: user });\n  } catch (e) {\n    yield put({ type: 'FAIL_USER', error: e });\n  }\n}\n\nit('fetches user', () => {\n  return expectSaga(userSaga)\n    .call.fn(api.fetchUser)\n    .run();\n});\n\nit('fails', () => {\n  return expectSaga(userSaga)\n    .provide({\n      call() {\n        throw new Error('Not Found');\n      },\n    })\n    .put.actionType('FAIL_USER')\n    .run();\n});\n\nMultiple Properties\nIf you need it in rare cases, you can match on multiple shallow or deep\nproperties via like:\nfunction* saga(id) {\n  yield put({\n    type: 'FOO',\n    payload: 42,\n    meta: { hello: 'world' },\n  });\n\n  // This will be matched\n  yield put({\n    type: 'FOO',\n    payload: 43,\n    meta: { hello: 'world' },\n  });\n}\n\nit('can match on multiple properties', () => {\n  return expectSaga(saga)\n    .put.like({\n      action: {\n        type: 'FOO',\n        payload: 43,\n      },\n    })\n    .run();\n});\n\nHelper Methods\nThere are other some common helper methods like fn and actionType available,\nappropriate to the kind of effect:\n\n\n\nMethod\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nactionChannel.pattern\nMatch actionChannel by pattern. Useful if you use custom buffers with actionChannel.\n\n\napply.fn\nMatch apply by fn.\n\n\ncall.fn\nMatch call by fn.\n\n\ncps.fn\nMatch cps by fn.\n\n\nfork.fn\nMatch fork by fn.\n\n\nput.actionType\nMatch put by action.type.\n\n\nput.resolve.actionType\nMatch put.resolve by action.type.\n\n\nselect.selector\nMatch select by selector function.\n\n\nspawn.fn\nMatch spawn by fn.\n\n\n\n"},"integration-testing/negated-assertions.html":{"url":"integration-testing/negated-assertions.html","title":"Negated Assertions","keywords":"","body":"Negated Assertions\nYou can negate assertions too.

must be saved prior)\n\n\n\nGo Back or Restart\nFor simple time travel, the mock saga includes back and restart methods\nwhich allow you to back up some number of steps or completely restart the saga.\nThis is useful for handling multiple control flow branches such as if/else and\ntry/catch.\nback takes an optional number argument to specify the number of steps to back\nup. It defaults to 1.\nAs its name suggestions, restart will restart your saga. If your saga takes\narguments, then you can restart with new arguments by passing them in to\nrestart. If you don't supply any arguments, then it will restart with whatever\noriginal arguments you used.\nfunction getPredicate() {}\n\nfunction* mainSaga(x) {\n  try {\n    const predicate = yield select(getPredicate);\n\n    if (predicate) {\n      yield take('TRUE');\n    } else {\n      yield take('FALSE');\n    }\n\n    yield put({ type: 'DONE', payload: x });\n  } catch (e) {\n    yield take('ERROR');\n  }\n}\n\nlet saga = testSaga(mainSaga, 42);\n\n// Back up one step by default\nsaga\n  .next()\n  .select(getPredicate)\n\n  .back()\n  .next()\n  .select(getPredicate);\n\n// Back up `2` steps to try `else` branch\nsaga = testSaga(mainSaga, 42);\nsaga\n  .next()\n  .select(getPredicate)\n\n  .next(true)\n  .take('TRUE')\n\n  .next()\n  .isDone()\n\n  .back(2)\n  .next(false)\n  .take('FALSE')\n\n  .next()\n  .put({ type: 'DONE', payload: 42 })\n\n  .next()\n  .isDone();\n\n// Restart from the beginning to throw\nconst error = new Error('My Error');\nsaga = testSaga(mainSaga, 42);\n\nsaga\n  .next()\n  .select(getPredicate)\n\n  .next(true)\n  .take('TRUE')\n\n  .next()\n  .put({ type: 'DONE', payload: 42 })\n\n  .next()\n  .isDone()\n\n  .restart()\n  .next()\n  .throw(error)\n  .take('ERROR')\n\n  .next()\n  .isDone();\n\n// Restart to update the argument\nsaga = testSaga(mainSaga, 42);\n\nsaga\n  .next()\n  .select(getPredicate)\n\n  .next(true)\n  .take('TRUE')\n\n  .next()\n  .put({ type: 'DONE', payload: 42 })\n\n  .next()\n  .isDone()\n\n  .restart('hello world')\n  .next()\n  .select(getPredicate)\n\n  .next(true)\n  .take('TRUE')\n\n  .next()\n  .put({ type: 'DONE', payload: 'hello world' })\n\n  .next()\n  .isDone();\n\nFinish Early\nIf you want to finish a saga early like bailing out of a while loop, then you\ncan use the finish method.\nfunction identity(value) {\n  return value;\n}\n\nfunction* loopingSaga() {\n  while (true) {\n    const action = yield take('HELLO');\n    yield call(identity, action);\n  }\n}\n\nlet saga = testSaga(loopingSaga);\n\nsaga\n  .next()\n\n  .take('HELLO')\n  .next(action)\n  .call(identity, action)\n  .next()\n\n  .take('HELLO')\n  .next(action)\n  .call(identity, action)\n  .next()\n\n  .finish()\n  .next()\n  .isDone();\n\n// With argument(s)\n\nsaga = testSaga(loopingSaga);\n\nsaga\n  .next()\n\n  .take('HELLO')\n  .next(action)\n  .call(identity, action)\n  .next()\n\n  .take('HELLO')\n  .next(action)\n  .call(identity, action)\n  .next()\n\n  .finish(42)\n  .returns(42);\n\nSave and Restore History\nFor more robust time travel, you can use the save and restore methods. The\nsave method allows you to label a point in the saga that you can return to by\ncalling restore with the same label. This can be more useful and less brittle\nthan using the simple back method.\nfunction getPredicate() {}\nfunction getFinalPayload() {}\n\nexport default function* mainSaga() {\n  try {\n    yield take('READY');\n\n    const predicate = yield select(getPredicate);\n\n    if (predicate) {\n      yield take('TRUE');\n    } else {\n      yield take('FALSE');\n    }\n\n    let payload = yield select(getFinalPayload);\n\n    payload %= 101;\n\n    yield put({ payload, type: 'DONE' });\n  } catch (e) {\n    yield take('ERROR');\n  }\n}\n\nconst saga = testSaga(mainSaga);\n\nsaga\n  .next()\n  .take('READY')\n\n  .next()\n  .select(getPredicate)\n\n  .save('before predicate') // \nAs the names suggest save and restore allow you to restore saved history.\nThis can sometimes be beneficial for fast forwarding through a saga.\nsaga\n  .next()\n  .take('READY')\n\n  .next()\n  .select(getPredicate)\n\n  .save('before predicate') // \nNOTE\nDespite what the previous example suggests, save and restore don't\nnecessarily allow you to jump forward in your saga. As mentioned, they\nrestore history. This means the saga will be restarted, and the history for\nthe named label will be applied to get you back to a certain point in the saga.\nFor some cases, you can use this to jump forward, but in other cases, you might\nexpect the internal state of your saga to be different from what the applied\nhistory had. Here's an example to show what wouldn't work with save and\nrestore.\nfunction getPredicate() {}\nfunction itWasTrue() {}\nfunction itWasFalse() {}\n\nexport default function* mainSaga() {\n  try {\n    yield take('READY');\n\n    const predicate = yield select(getPredicate);\n\n    if (predicate) {\n      yield take('TRUE');\n      yield call(itWasTrue);\n    } else {\n      yield take('FALSE');\n      yield call(itWasFalse);\n    }\n\n    yield put({ type: 'DONE', payload: predicate });\n  } catch (e) {\n    yield take('ERROR');\n  }\n}\n\nconst saga = testSaga(mainSaga);\n\nsaga\n  .next()\n  .take('READY')\n\n  .next()\n  .select(getPredicate)\n\n  .save('before predicate') // \nEven though we restore the 'before predicate' label and supply a new value to\nthe predicate variable, that will get overwritten to whatever the history for\npredicate was when we saved the 'before final put' label. True time travel\nis not available yet but is a tentatively planned feature in the future. Ideas\nand contributions are welcome to add true time travel.\n"}}}
